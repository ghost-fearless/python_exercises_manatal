It took me a long time because I have to create a unittest, which should be standard cause unittests rocks!

excercise 2
start 13:01, end 13:33
It took me a long time because I need to relearn how roman numerals work, there is some confusion about IIII vs IV(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#cite_note-2), I gotta go eat some lunch, do my laundry and get back and start the exercise 4, proly later tonight.
